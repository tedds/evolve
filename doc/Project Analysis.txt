PROJECT ANALYSYS:

CARATTERISTICHE CHE OGNI ATTORE DEVE AVERE ALL'INTERNO DEL SISTEMA:

1. LOGICAL CALCULAE: 
The logical constants FOR-ALL, THERE-EXISTS, AND, OR, NOT, and IMPLIES are defined as actors.
E' necessario usare/considerare in qualche maniera queste costanti logiche e' definirle come attori o come comportamento specifico degli attori?
In ogni caso possono essere prese come spunto per eventulai comportamenti specifico di tutti gli attori.

 - FOR-ALL
 - THERE-EXISTS
 - AND
 - OR
 - NOT
 - IMPLIES
 
2. - KNOWLEDGE BASED PROGRAMMING:
The actor formalism aids knowledge based programming in the following ways

- PROCEDURAL EMBEDDING of KNOWLEDGE (da considerarsi come comportamento e/o conoscenza interna dell'Attore?) 
- TRACING BEHAVIORAL DEPENDENCIES and SUBSTANTIATING(trace del comportamento di convalida delle dipendenze ?) 

that ACTORS SATISFY their INTENTIONS.

3. - INTENTIONS:
Every actor has an INTENTION which checks that the prerequisites and the context of the actor being sent the message are satisfied. 
The intention is the CONTRACT that the actor has with the outside world. How an actor fulfills its contract is its own business.

4. - Hierarchies:
The model provides for the following orthogonal hierarchies:
-	SCHEDULING: Every actor has a scheduler which determines when the actor actually acts after it 1s sent a message. 
				The scheduler handles problems of synchronization. 
				Another job of the scheduler [Rulifson] is to try to cause actors to act in an order such that their intentions will be satisfied.
-	INTENTIONS: Every actor has an intention which makes certain that the prerequisites and context of the actor being sent the message are satisfied.
				Intentions provide a certain amount of redundancy in the specifications of what is supposed to happen.
-	MONITORING: Every actor can have monitors which look over each message sent to the actor.
-	BINDING: Every actor can have a procedure for looking up the values of names that occur within 1t.
-	RESOURCE MANAGEMENT: Every actor has a banker which monitors the use of space and time.
